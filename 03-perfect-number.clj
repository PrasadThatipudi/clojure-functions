;; PROBLEM 3: Check if a number is perfect
;; A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
;; Proper divisors are all positive divisors except the number itself.
;; Find all divisors efficiently and check if their sum equals the original number.
;; Example: 28 -> true (divisors: 1,2,4,7,14 and 1+2+4+7+14=28), 12 -> false, 6 -> true
