;; PROBLEM 6: Check if a number is palindromic
;; A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.
;; Convert the number to string and check if it's equal to its reverse.
;; Do NOT use built-in reverse functions - implement the reversal logic yourself.
;; Example: 12321 -> true, 12345 -> false, 7 -> true, 1001 -> true
