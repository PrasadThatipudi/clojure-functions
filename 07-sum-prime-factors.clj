;; PROBLEM 7: Sum of unique prime factors
;; Find all unique prime factors of a given number and return their sum.
;; For example, if n = 12, prime factors are 2 and 3, so sum = 5.
;; If n = 30, prime factors are 2, 3, and 5, so sum = 10.
;; Implement efficient prime factorization and ensure each prime is counted only once.
;; Example: 60 -> prime factors: 2,3,5 -> sum = 10, 17 -> 17 (itself is prime)
(def n 60)
